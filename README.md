This is a currently ongoing [Reverse Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering) of a Pokemon Distribution Cartridge of the 4th generation    
(Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Heartgold, Soulsilver) 
to better understand the pokemon data structure.   
    
    
It is still in early beta (most of the file in this repo are development tools)
    
Come back in a few months to distribute your own event pokemon for your unmodified childhood game !
